{100}{}{This is Ranger Oscar.}
{101}{}{You see a middle-aged man. He wears gloves and a revolver on his belt.}
{102}{}{I would like your technology to drive away the missionaries.}
{103}{}{I'm leaving the pueblo soon. The rangers are no longer welcome here. It's sad.}
{104}{}{Thanks for the help. Your dedication will go down in history.}
{105}{}{We'll meet again, amigo.}
{106}{}{It's better for you if our paths don't cross again.}
{107}{}{I need to get ready for battle. We meet near the mission camp.}

# Before receiving the quest
{200}{}{Hello}
{201}{}{Bye}
{202}{}{[Cheat: get out of the pueblo, ranger]}
{203}{}{[Cheat: you won]}
{204}{}{[Cheat: give a quest to eliminate missionaries]}

{210}{}{So. Wait a minute. Who are you? Of the missionaries?}
{211}{}{No, just a traveler. And I'm already leaving.}
{212}{}{No, no, I'm from a ruined village in the northwest.}
{213}{}{A village? There are few settlements there. It looks like you're just lying.}
{214}{}{I'm telling you... It doesn't matter. Where are you from?}
{215}{}{Let it remain a secret. Better take care of yourself.}
{216}{}{See you, stranger.}
{217}{}{If so, then what?}
{218}{}{I don't like you. Like everyone else who came from the east. If I find out that you are a spy of the missionaries, you will immediately get a bullet in the forehead.}
{219}{}{The chiefs let me in.}
{220}{}{Your happiness. I wouldn't do that in their place.}
{221}{}{I'm not from the East. And from the northwest.}
{222}{}{See you, stranger.}
{223}{}{And why did they let you in? Aren't you a stranger yourself?}
{224}{}{Chief Geronimo sent me to you. How can I help?}
{225}{}{Well, an extra pair of legs and arms will be very useful.}
{226}{}{If I were him, I wouldn't be in such a hurry. But an extra pair of legs and arms really wouldn't hurt me.}
{227}{}{Report the situation, Ranger.}
{228}{}{Are you Ranger Oscar? General Mossman sent me. He demands a report.}
{229}{}{It's a strange thing. I don't understand why he sent you and not one of the rangers... But the general knows better.}

{230}{}{I was sent to San Brahmin to restore order. The tribe is trying to defend its freedom and independence from the Phoenician Empire. The situation is complicated and at any moment it can go from local skirmishes to a state of real war.}
{231}{}{Go on.}
{232}{}{Get to the point, please.}
{233}{}{A detachment of Phoenicians came from the east. They have set up their camp near the Pueblo and are trying to drive the tribe away. They say they want to conclude a trade agreement with them. But this is complete nonsense.}
{234}{}{What's wrong?}
{235}{}{No empire in history has been so courteous to the locals during the expansion. As soon as the alliance is concluded, the tribe will be disarmed, and the Brahmins will be distributed to those who will obey the will of the emperor.}
{236}{}{[Listen]}
{237}{}{The Phoenix cannot be trusted. It's a bunch of adventurers and bandits. The townspeople simply do not know any other life. And the tribe of cattle breeders has been creating its own culture and traditions for generations. Some greedy rich people from the city can't ruin their lives.}
{238}{}{Clearly. Do you want to drive the missionaries back to the city?}
{239}{}{Our forces are unequal to go into open battle. And within the tribe, a split is maturing, which was generated by the Phoenicians among the youth. Help prepare a squad to expel the missionaries. It is necessary to heal the wounded and to reason with the son of Chief Chatto.}
{240}{}{Okay. I'll see what I can do.}
{241}{}{I doubt your squad can handle it. I'll try to find another way.}

{242}{}{Hello, sectarian. What are you counting on? Oh, I know - for a bullet in the forehead.}
{243}{}{Wait a minute...}
{244}{}{What are you...}
{245}{}{Get out! So that your spirit will not be on the land of cattle breeders. You, Aaron's henchmen, were not invited here.}
{246}{}{Okay... calm down... I'm leaving.}
{247}{}{A ranger? What a pleasant surprise. The General Staff did not warn me about your appointment. Are you here of your own free will?}
{248}{}{No, I'm just passing by. What's going on here? Do you need help?}
{249}{}{Just along the way. Sorry, I have to move on soon. Maybe we'll meet again.}

{250}{}{Didn't they tell you to get out of the pueblo? If you continue to resist, I will have to use force to drive you away from this holy land.}
{251}{}{It was a mistake. Give me a chance, I'll fix it!}
{252}{}{You have no power here. You're as much an outsider as I am. So sit tight and keep quiet.}
{253}{}{I bet my hat-you can't drive me away. What is it, stupid? Are your fingers itching already? So come on! Get out your revolver, you son of a bitch!}
{254}{}{Let's discuss the action plan again. What needs to be done?}

{260}{}{Leave the pueblo immediately. Commander Crook gives you one last chance to avoid the death penalty.}
{261}{}{I can't be intimidated by death. I went on this mission fully aware of the risks. But my goal is higher than my life. I tried to save the tribe from extermination or enslavement by imperial troops.}
{262}{}{It's over. The elders advocate a truce with the missionaries.}
{263}{}{I see. The missionaries have completely clouded their minds. There is no sadder sight than the powerlessness of power.}
{264}{}{Now the majority is against you. So are you going to leave?}
{265}{}{I'll have to go back to base with nothing. But don't think the Rangers will just let it go. The Phoenix Empire cannot be allowed to sweep away entire nations in its path for the sake of power and resources.}
{266}{}{Cheer up. You will still have a chance to take revenge. Probably.}
{267}{}{Right. Get out of here.}
{268}{}{So you're not going to leave?}
{269}{}{No. I will stay to protect the tribe during the siege. And I won't be alone. There are still people in the tribe who are ready to stand up for themselves.}
{270}{}{As you wish. But you've been officially warned.}
{271}{}{Do as you like. My job is to warn.}
{272}{}{The desert teaches you to hide in the shadows and wait for the right moment to attack. Use this tactic, otherwise you will lose.}
{273}{}{Sometimes it is more useful to retreat to gather strength. Isn't that the case?}
{274}{}{The Parker Dam was flooded and destroyed. Your command will no longer be able to support the struggle in San Brahmin.}
{275}{}{It's over. The Supreme Leader turned away from the Rangers.}

#After receiving the quest
{300}{}{Report back. Any information about our enemy will be valuable.}
{301}{}{I have nothing to report yet.}
{302}{}{Good to see you, Ranger.}
{303}{}{Good to see you, amigo.}

{310}{}{I want to ask you about the Arizona Rangers.}
{311}{}{We represent Law and Order in these lands.}
{312}{}{Do the Rangers have a base?}
{313}{}{The General Staff in the west and many outposts throughout Southern Arizona. But it would be silly to tell you their exact location. }
{314}{}{The General Staff in the west and many outposts throughout Southern Arizona. But you already know where it is.}
{315}{}{Where's your badge, Ranger?}
{316}{}{I removed it only in order not to aggravate the difficult situation. As things get better in Pueblo, the badge will be on my chest again.}
{317}{}{I don't understand why the Rangers are getting involved in this war?}
{318}{}{We have two goals - to make friends with the tribe and stop the expansion of the Phoenix.}
{319}{}{Isn't the enforcement of the law contrary to the principles of the tribe?}
{320}{}{Simple rules are the same for everyone - do not kill for no reason, do not steal someone else's. As for the local foundations, the Rangers have to put up with them and make some adjustments.}
{321}{}{Clear.}

{330}{}{The missionaries fled back to Phoenix.}
{331}{}{You have amazing diplomatic skills. I don't know how you managed to sort it out, but I'm very grateful.}
{332}{}{It's nothing. They turned out to be quite skittish.}
{333}{}{It wasn't easy. But our great mission requires sacrifice.}
{334}{}{General Mossman did not entrust you with such a serious task for nothing. He has a nose for good people. Now I will be able to return to the base after a long and stressful mission.}
{335}{}{Good luck, Oscar.}
{336}{}{The Rangers need people like you. Stop by our base in Parker Dam. I will pass the recommendation on you to the general.}
{337}{}{Thank you, Ranger. I'll be in those parts, I'll definitely look in on the general.}

{340}{}{Chatto refused to support the Phoenicians.}
{341}{}{Good news. If Chatto does not create problems, then our chances of winning increase dramatically.}
{342}{}{What else needs to be done?}
{343}{}{It remains to raise the soldiers and go into battle. But some are lying wounded. This scares the cattlemen, besides, some of them could go into battle if they were patched up.}
{344}{}{I'll cure them.}
{345}{}{Thank you. A commendable initiative. But if you don't know how to treat people, then at least bring them medicines. Surely something can be stolen from the missionaries.}
{346}{}{I'm on my way.}
{347}{}{But I'm not a doctor.}
{348}{}{Then bring the medicines. Surely something can be stolen from the missionaries.}
{349}{}{I'm on my way.}
{350}{}{All the wounded are back in the ranks. We can perform.}
{351}{}{Great. It remains to assemble a squad and conduct an instruction. Meet me north of the missionaries' camp. Get ready for an uphill battle.}
{352}{}{I'm on my way.}
{353}{}{Chatto is no more, he can't interfere with your plans.}
{354}{}{This is not good news. Chatto was a leader among the youth and could influence the minds of his fellow tribesmen. It remains to be hoped that none of the dissenters will stand in our way.}
{355}{}{Then you have no choice. Crook is waiting for your attack. Come on, show me what you're capable of, Ranger!}
{356}{}{Go back to Crook and let him know that I accept his challenge. If he wants a fight, he'll get it.}
{357}{}{Bye.}
{358}{}{Good job. But what about Chatto? Did you manage to convince him?}
{359}{}{I haven't been able to talk to him yet.}

# during the skirmish
{360}{}{Hmm. It doesn't look like the missionaries are preparing for battle. Their self-confidence is good for us. It's a good time to start the offensive.}
{361}{}{Ranger Oscar, may I conduct a reconnaissance? I'll be back soon.}
{362}{}{Let the battle begin!}
{363}{}{I report: the missionaries have fled!}
{364}{}{Victory is ours! (The warriors of the tribe cheerfully rejoice) I still need time to look around. And you go back to the pueblo, we'll sum up there.}
{365}{}{See you later.}
{366}{}{In that case, you'll die like a dog. Whining and vainly begging for mercy.}
{367}{}{That's enough! Time's up, Ranger...}
{368}{}{Drive away the Phoenicians!}
{369}{}{Vper-ed!}
{370}{}{If Crook and his whole pack don't immediately capitulate together, then we'll have to force him out.}
{371}{}{I will inform him of your requirements.}
{372}{}{The fight is over. We have won!}
