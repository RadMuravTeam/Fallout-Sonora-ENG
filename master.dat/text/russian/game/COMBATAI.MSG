{44945}{}{Tell me your name so I can contact your next of kin.}
{44946}{}{I'm the one who put the 'death' in deathclaw!}
{44947}{}{It's better to give than to receive!}
{44948}{}{I hope you're enjoying this as much as I am!}
{44949}{}{Did that hurt? If not I can do it harder next time.}
{44950}{}{We have a bleeder over here!}
{44951}{}{It'll take more than a stimpak to fix you when I'm done.}
{44952}{}{I hope you have medical insurance. You're going to need it.}
{44953}{}{Here a rip, there a rip, everywhere a rip rip...}
{44954}{}{I don't care who started it, I intend to finish it!}
{44955}{}{I love the sound of tearing flesh, don't you?}

{44960}{}{Would it help you if I just stood here?}
{44961}{}{Glasses. You should look into getting some glasses.}
{44962}{}{You need me to paint a target for you?}
{44963}{}{Why are you aiming over there when I'm over here?}
{44964}{}{I hope you aren't making a career out of this.}
{44965}{}{How did you manage to miss something as big as I am?}
{44966}{}{Ha! Argh grrnnngh thppppt! (Deathclaw ridicule)}
{44967}{}{I'm a nimble little shit aint I?}
{44968}{}{You should be glad your mother didn't see you do that.}
{44969}{}{You really should consider getting more practice.}
{44970}{}{How embarrassing. I won't tell anyone how lame you are.}
{44971}{}{So, you're trained to miss the target?}
{44972}{}{Doesn't that just piss you off?}
{44973}{}{Don't cry. Maybe you'll get lucky next time.}
{44974}{}{Way to go, Grace. What do you do for an encore?}
{44975}{}{That was a shinning example of missing the target.}
{44976}{}{I'm beginning to think you're not cut out for this.}
{44977}{}{Are you trying to make me laugh myself to death?}
{44978}{}{You fanned the air on that one!}
{44979}{}{Did you just miss me or what!}
